As a Full Professor and Head of the School of Applied Data Science at Modul University Vienna, Austria, I hold a strong background in data science and AI research.

Prior to my current position, I served as a Reader in Data Science at the University of Wolverhampton, where I spearheaded the establishment and leadership of the Data Science and AI research group, DAIREL. My research interests encompass user-oriented information retrieval (IR), artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), data science, and digital libraries.

My expertise extends beyond academia, encompassing experience in both research and industry settings. Notably, I held the position of General Chair at ACM CIKM 2023 in Birmingham, with more than 650 delegates working in the areas of IR, AI, knowledge management, and deep learning. Furthermore, I am the Principal Investigator (PI) of the EU Horizon Europe Marie Skłodowska Curie Staff Exchange project OMINO (both for the University of Wolverhampton and Modul University), which received funding from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to address the issue of information overload. Additionally, I was the PI of the EU H2020 Marie Skłodowska Curie European Training Network QUARTZ, which focused on quantum-inspired information retrieval.

In addition to my research contributions, I have actively participated in European and nationally funded projects in the domains of information retrieval, artificial intelligence, digital libraries, digital preservation, and collaboration. These projects have been conducted in collaboration with highly esteemed partners from both the research and industry sectors.

Beyond research, I have honed my skills in designing, implementing, integrating, and evaluating research prototypes and software modules. Furthermore, I have led commercial software projects as a consultant, providing valuable insights and expertise to industry stakeholders.

I am the senior managing editor of the International Journal on Digital Libraries (http://link.springer.com/journal/799). Furthermore., I hold the position of chair of the BCS Information Retrieval Study Group (BCS-IRSG). My extensive experience includes serving as a senior programme chair member and reviewer for numerous world-renowned conferences, such as SIGIR, ECIR, CIKM, ICTIR, JCDL, and TPDL. Furthermore, I have successfully organised workshops and schools on information retrieval, for example ELLIS ESSIR 2025 and the BIR/SCOLIA workshop series on scholarly information access.

My expertise encompasses a diverse range of computer science topics, encompassing information retrieval, artificial intelligence, machine learning, databases, data modelling and management, programming, internet technologies, and distributed and parallel computing.
