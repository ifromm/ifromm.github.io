<h1>Profile</h1>
Ingo Frommholz is a senior lecturer in computer science at the
Department of Computer Science and Technology of the University of
Bedfordshire in Luton. Prior to this he worked as a research associate
at the University of Glasgow, and as a research assistant at the
University of Duisburg-Essen and the Fraunhofer Integrated
Publications and Information Systems Institute (IPSI) in Darmstadt,
Germany, where he contributed to a number of European (FP5, FP6 and
FP7) and national German and British projects. He gained further
practical experience as a software developer in various companies in
Germany and in consulting projects on enterprise search. Ingo received
his PhD in 2008 at the University of Duisburg-Essen on the topic of
probabilistic logic-based information retrieval models. His current
research focuses on formal models for information seeking and
searching, for instance based on probabilistic logics and on quantum
probabilities. He has a strong expertise in information retrieval, digital
libraries and information systems. Ingo is the Managing Editor of the
International Journal on Digital Libraries and member of the steering
committees of the BCS and the German Information Retrieval Study
Groups. He has been reviewer for several world-class conferences and
journals.
