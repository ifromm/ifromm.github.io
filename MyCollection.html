 Supporting Polyrepresentation in a Quantum-inspired Geometrical

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The relevance of a document has many facets, going beyond the usual topical one, which have to be considered to satisfy a user’s information need. Multiple representations of doc- uments, like user-given reviews or the actual document con- tent, can give evidence towards certain facets of relevance. In this respect polyrepresentation of documents, where such evidence is combined, is a crucial concept to estimate the relevance of a document. In this paper, we discuss how a ge- ometrical retrieval framework inspired by quantum mechan- ics can be extended to support polyrepresentation. We show by example how different representations of a document can be modelled in a Hilbert space, similar to physical systems known from quantum mechanics. We further illustrate how these representations are combined by means of the tensor product to support polyrepresentation, and discuss the case that representations of documents are not independent from a user point of view. Besides giving a principled framework for polyrepresentation, the potential of this approach is to capture and formalise the complex interdependent relation- ships that the different representations can have between each other.

This study explores the benefits of integrating knowledge representations in prior art patent retrieval. Key to the introduced approach is the utilization of human judgment available in the form of classifications assigned to patent documents. The paper first outlines in detail how a methodology for the extraction of knowledge from such an hierarchical classification system can be established. Further potential ways of integrating this knowledge with existing Information Retrieval paradigms in a scalable and flexible manner are investigated. Finally based on these integration strategies the effectiveness in terms of recall and precision is evaluated in the context of a prior art search task for European patents. As a result of this evaluation it can be established that in general the proposed knowledge expansion techniques are particularly beneficial to recall and, with respect to optimizing field retrieval settings, further result in significant precision gains.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Ingwersen’s cognitive framework is regarded as the begin- ning of a turn which eventually should bring together classical system- oriented and user-oriented IR communities. One of the consequences of this framework is the polyrepresentation principle. The Logical Uncertainty Principle (LUP) is regarded as a compatible model with the cognitive framework. Recently it was shown how LUP can be expressed using the mathematics of Hilbert spaces. This formalism, which is applied in quantum mechanics, harmonises geometry, probability theory and logics. Apart from being a way to express LUP, a further potential arises from a quantum perspective of IR. We present an interactive framework as an example of a quantum-inspired approach which also supports polyrepresentation.

 Determining the Polarity of Postings for Discussion Search.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
When performing discussion search it might be desirable to consider non-topical measures like the number of positive and negative replies to a posting, for instance as one possible indicator for the trustworthiness of a comment. Systems like POLAR are able to integrate such values into the retrieval function. To automatically detect the polarity of postings, they need to be classified into positive and negative ones w.r.t. the comment or document they are annotating. We present a machine learning approach for polarity detection which is based on Support Vector Machines. We discuss and identify appropriate term and context features. Experiments with ZDNet News show that an accuracy of around 79%-80% can be achieved for automatically classifying comments according to their polarity.

 <em>A Probabilistic Framework for Information Modelling and
  Retrieval Based on User Annotations on Digital Objects</em>.
 Phd thesis, 2008.
[&nbsp;<a href="MyCollection_bib.html#Frommholz:08">bib</a>&nbsp;]

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Annotations are a means to make critical remarks, to explain and comment things, to add notes and give opinions, and to relate objects. Nowadays, they can be found in digital libraries and collaboratories, for example as a building block for scientific discussion on the one hand or as private notes on the other. We further find them in product reviews, scientific databases and many &ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; applications; even well-established concepts like emails can be regarded as annotations in a certain sense. Digital annotations can be (textual) comments, markings (i.e. highlighted parts) and references to other documents or document parts. Since annotations convey information which is potentially important to satisfy a user's information need, this thesis tries to answer the question of how to exploit annotations for information retrieval. It gives a first answer to the question if retrieval effectiveness can be improved with annotations. 
A survey of the &ldquo;annotation universe&rdquo; reveals some facets of annotations; for example, they can be content level annotations (extending the content of the annotation object) or meta level ones (saying something about the annotated object). Besides the annotations themselves, other objects created during the process of annotation can be interesting for retrieval, these being the annotated fragments. These objects are integrated into an object-oriented model comprising digital objects such as structured documents and annotations as well as fragments. In this model, the different relationships among the various objects are reflected. From this model, the basic data structure for annotation-based retrieval, the structured annotation hypertext, is derived. 
In order to thoroughly exploit the information contained in structured annotation hypertexts, a probabilistic, object-oriented logical framework called POLAR is introduced. In POLAR, structured annotation hypertexts can be modelled by means of probabilistic propositions and four-valued logics. POLAR allows for specifying several relationships among annotations and annotated (sub)parts or fragments. Queries can be posed to extract the knowledge contained in structured annotation hypertexts. POLAR supports annotation-based retrieval, i.e. document and discussion search, by applying an augmentation strategy (knowledge augmentation, propagating propositions from subcontexts like annotations, or relevance augmentation, where retrieval status values are propagated) in conjunction with probabilistic inference, where P(d rightarrow q), the probability that a document d implies a query q, is estimated. POLAR's semantics is based on possible worlds and accessibility relations. It is implemented on top of four-valued probabilistic Datalog. 
POLAR's core retrieval functionality, knowledge augmentation with probabilistic inference, is evaluated for discussion and document search. The experiments show that all relevant POLAR objects, merged annotation targets, fragments and content annotations, are able to increase retrieval effectiveness when used as a context for discussionor document search. Additional experiments reveal that we can determine the polarity of annotations with an accuracy of around 80%.

The goal of the track was to set up a testbed consisting of several different and diverse collections and defining retrieval tasks and appropriate topics.

Annotations are an important part in today's digital libraries and Web information systems as an instrument for interactive knowledge creation. Annotation-based document retrieval aims at exploiting annotations as a rich source of evidence for document search. The POLAR framework supports annotation-based document search by translating POLAR programs into four-valued probabilistic datalog and applying a retrieval strategy called knowledge augmentation, where the content of a document is augmented with the content of its attached annotations. In order to evaluate this approach and POLAR's performance in document search, we set up a test collection based on a snapshot of ZDNet News, containing IT-related articles and attached discussion threads. Our evaluation shows that knowledge augmentation has the potential to increase retrieval effectiveness when applied in a moderate way.

In this paper we introduce POLAR, a probabilistic object-oriented
logical
framework for annotation-based information retrieval. In POLAR, the
knowledge about digital objects, annotations and their relationships in a
digital library repository can be modelled considering certain
characteristics of annotations and annotated objects. Insights about these
characteristics are gained by an analysis of the annotation models behind
existing systems and a discussion of an object-oriented, logical view
on relevant objects in a digital library. Retrieval methods applied in a
digital library should take annotations into account to satisfy users'
information needs. POLAR thus supports a wide range of flexible and powerful
annotation-based fact and content queries by
making use of knowledge and relevance augmentation. An evaluation of our
approach on email discussions shows performance improvements when
annotation characteristics are considered.

 Document-centered Collaboration for Scholars in the Humanities - The
  COLLATE System.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In contrast to electronic document collections we find in contemporary digital libraries, systems applied in a cultural domain have to satisfy specific requirements with respect to data ingest, management, and access. Such systems should as well be able to support the collaborative work of domain experts and furthermore offer mechanisms to exploit the value-added information resulting from collaborative process like scientific discussions. In this paper, we present the solutions to these requirements developed and realized in the COLLATE system, where advanced methods for document classification, content management, and context-based retrieval using scientific discourses are applied.

 Kontextbasiertes Retrieval unter Verwendung verkn&uuml;pfter
  Annotationen.
 In <em>32. GI-Jahrestagung</em>, Informatik 2002, pages 161-165,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Kollaborative Arbeitsumgebungen im Web k�nnen Mechanismen enthalten, mit denen neben dem Erstellen von zum Dokument geh�enden Metadaten auch ein wissenschaftlicher Diskurs �ber das eigentliche Dokument gef�hrt werden kann (z.B. �ber freie Annotationen). Dieser Diskurs kann wertvolle Informationen �ber das Dokument enthalten, die aus den Metadaten nicht ersichtlich sind. Es wird gezeigt, wie sich ein solcher wissenschaftlicher Diskurs mittels Annotationen und Diskursstrukturrelationen modellieren l��t und wie man die daraus gewonnenen Informationen beim Retrieval ausnutzen kann.

 How to Incorporate Collaborative Discourse in Cultural Digital
  Libraries.
 In <em>Proceedings of the ECAI 2002 Workshop on Semantic Authoring,
  Annotation &amp; Knowledge Markup (SAAKM02)</em>, Lyon, France, July 2002.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Discourse structure relations can be used to establish collaborative discourses within a cultural digital library. Ranging from factual to more interpersonal levels they describe the intended relations between data and metadata objects, especially annotations. Pragmatics aspects are covered by communicative acts, which complement the discourse structure relations and provide means for meta-communication. The resulting interrelations between the various domain objects can be employed to perform advanced context -based retrieval.

 Categorizing Web Documents in Hierarchical Catalogues.
 In <em>23th European Conference on Information Retrieval Research
  (ECIR 2001)</em>, 2001.
[&nbsp;<a href="MyCollection_bib.html#Frommholz:01a">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
Automatic categorization of web documents (e.g. HTML documents) denotes the task of automatically finding relevant categories for a (new) document which is to be inserted into a web catalogue like Yahoo!.Thereexist many approaches for performing this difficult task. Here, special kinds of web catalogues, those whose category scheme is hierarchically ordered, are regarded. A method for using the knowledge about the hierarchy to gain better categorization results is discussed. This method can be applied in a post-processing step and therefore be combined with other known (non-hierarchical) categorization approaches.
