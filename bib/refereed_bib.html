Here, special kinds of web catalogues, those whose category scheme is hierarchically ordered, are regarded. A method for using the knowledge about the hierarchy to gain better categorization results is discussed. This method can be applied in a post-processing step and therefore be combined with other known (non-hierarchical) categorization approaches.},

logical
framework for annotation-based information retrieval. In POLAR, the
knowledge about digital objects, annotations and their relationships in a
digital library repository can be modelled considering certain
characteristics of annotations and annotated objects. Insights about these
characteristics are gained by an analysis of the annotation models behind
existing systems and a discussion of an object-oriented, logical view
on relevant objects in a digital library. Retrieval methods applied in a
digital library should take annotations into account to satisfy users'
information needs. POLAR thus supports a wide range of flexible and powerful
annotation-based fact and content queries by
making use of knowledge and relevance augmentation. An evaluation of our
approach on email discussions shows performance improvements when

To gain access to this valuable information, discussion search is concerned with retrieving relevant annotations and comments w.r.t. a given query, making it an important means to satisfy users' information needs. Discussion search methods can make use of a variety of context information given by the structure of discussion threads. In this paper, we present and evaluate discussion search approaches which exploit quotations in different roles as highlight and context quotations, applying two different strategies, knowledge and relevance augmentation.

Annotation-based document retrieval aims at exploiting annotations as a rich source of evidence for document search. The POLAR framework supports annotation-based document search by translating POLAR programs into four-valued probabilistic datalog and applying a retrieval strategy called knowledge augmentation, where the content of a document is augmented with the content of its attached annotations. In order to evaluate this approach and POLAR's performance in document search, we set up a test collection based on a snapshot of ZDNet News, containing IT-related articles and attached discussion threads. Our evaluation shows that knowledge augmentation has the potential to increase retrieval effectiveness when applied in a moderate way.},

Key to the introduced approach is the utilization of human judgment available in the form of classifications assigned to patent documents. The paper first outlines in detail how a methodology for the extraction of knowledge from such an hierarchical classification system can be established. Further potential ways of integrating this knowledge with existing Information Retrieval paradigms in a scalable and flexible manner are investigated. Finally based on these integration strategies the effectiveness in terms of recall and precision is evaluated in the context of a prior art search task for European patents. As a result of this evaluation it can be established that in general the proposed knowledge expansion techniques are particularly beneficial to recall and, with respect to optimizing field retrieval settings, further result in significant precision gains.},

  abstract = {The relevance of a document has many facets, going beyond the usual topical one, which have to be considered to satisfy a user’s information need. Multiple representations of doc- uments, like user-given reviews or the actual document con- tent, can give evidence towards certain facets of relevance. In this respect polyrepresentation of documents, where such evidence is combined, is a crucial concept to estimate the relevance of a document. In this paper, we discuss how a ge- ometrical retrieval framework inspired by quantum mechan- ics can be extended to support polyrepresentation. We show by example how different representations of a document can be modelled in a Hilbert space, similar to physical systems known from quantum mechanics. We further illustrate how these representations are combined by means of the tensor product to support polyrepresentation, and discuss the case that representations of documents are not independent from a user point of view. Besides giving a principled framework for polyrepresentation, the potential of this approach is to capture and formalise the complex interdependent relation- ships that the different representations can have between each other.},
