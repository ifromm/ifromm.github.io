abstract = {Question Answering (QA) systems provide answers to Natural Language (NL) questions posed by humans. The Linked Data (LD) web provides an ideal knowledge base for QA as the framework expresses structure and relationships between data which assist in question parsing. Despite this, recent attempts at NL QA over LD struggle when faced with complex questions due to the challenges in automatically parsing NL into a structured query language, forcing end users to learn languages such as SPARQLwhich can be challenging for those without a technical background. There is a need for a system which returns accurate answers to complex natural language questions over linked data, improving the accessibility of linked data search by abstracting the complexity of SPARQL whilst retaining its expressivity. This work presents AQUACOLD (Aggregated Query Understanding And Construction Over Linked Data) a novel LD QA system which harnesses the power of crowdsourcing to meet this need. AQUACOLD uses query templates built by other users to answer questions which enables the system to handle queries of significant complexity. This paper provides an overview of the system and presents the results of a technical and user evaluation against the QALD-9 benchmark. Keywords},

abstract = {A major challenge of recommender systems is to help users locating interesting items. Personalized recommender systems have become very popular as they attempt to predetermine the needs of users and provide them with recommendations to personalize their navigation. However, few studies have addressed the question of what drives the users' attention to specific content within the collection and what influences the selection of interesting items. To this end, we employ the lens of Information Foraging Theory (IFT) to image recommendation to demonstrate how the user could utilize visual bookmarks to locate interesting images. We investigate a personalized content-based image recommendation system to understand what affects user attention by reinforcing visual attention cues based on IFT. We further find that visual bookmarks (cues) lead to a stronger scent of the recommended image collection. Our evaluation is based on the Pinterest image collection.},

abstract = {User implicit feedback plays an important role in recommender systems. However, finding implicit features is a tedious task. This paper aims to identify users' preferences through implicit behavioural signals for image recommendation based on the Information Scent Model of Information Foraging Theory. In the first part, we hypothesise that the users' perception is improved with visual cues in the images as behavioural signals that provide users' information scent during information seeking. We designed a content-based image recommendation system to explore which image attributes (i.e., visual cues or bookmarks) help users find their desired image. We found that users prefer recommendations predicated by visual cues and therefore consider the visual cues as good information scent for their information seeking. In the second part, we investigated if visual cues in the images together with the images itself can be better perceived by the users than each of them on its own. We evaluated the information scent artifacts in image recommendation on the Pinterest image collection and the WikiArt dataset. We find our proposed image recommendation system supports the implicit signals through Information Foraging explanation of the information scent model.},

abstract = {The Linked Data Web promises a disseminated, dynamic, ever expanding knowledge base where relationships between content and entities can be expressed and queried using formal logic rules. The data formats and exchange protocols that comprise the Linked DataWeb have existed for over 15 years and grown to incorporate over 149 billion triples but there is no established ‘mainstream' system that allows regular non-technical users to query the linked data web using natural language. In this paper we introduce Aquacold (Aggregated Query Understanding And Construction Over Linked Data), a novel Linked Data query tool designed to fill this gap. Aquacold combines a simple browsing interface for exploring, filtering and sorting linked data with query labelling which allows the user to store a natural language representation of the underlying SPARQL query. A search interface allows users to write guided natural language queries, which are converted into SPARQL queries to retrieve results from the linked data source. A set of voting tools are presented for each query and associated result set to surface the most accurate templates and relegate those that are less accurate. This crowdsourced approach for labelling, saving and voting on linked data query templates enables regular, non-technical users to make complex natural lan- guage queries over the linked data web without having to use a structured language such as SPARQL. In this paper we provide an overview of the system and discuss an early prototype.},

abstract = {Cyber security has become a major concern for users and businesses alike. Cyberstalking and harassment have been identified as a growing anti-social problem. Besides detecting cyberstalking and harassment, there is the need to gather digital evidence, often by the victim. To this end, we provide an overview of and discuss relevant technological means, in particular coming from text analytics as well as machine learning, that are capable to address the above challenges. We present a framework for the detection of text-based cyberstalking and the role and challenges of some core techniques such as author identification, text classification and personalisation. We then discuss PAN, a network and evaluation initiative that focusses on digital text forensics, in particular author identification.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. The BIR workshop brings together experts in Bibliometrics and Information Retrieval. While sometimes perceived as rather loosely related, these research areas share various interests and face similar challenges. Our motivation as organizers of the BIR workshop stemmed from a twofold observation. First, both communities only partly overlap, albeit sharing various interests. Second, it will be profitable for both sides to tackle some of the emerging problems that scholars face today when they have to identify relevant and high quality literature in the fast growing number of electronic publications available worldwide. Bibliometric techniques are not yet used widely to enhance retrieval processes in digital libraries, although they offer value-added effects for users. Information professionals working in libraries and archives, however, are increasingly confronted with applying bibliometric techniques in their services. The first BIR workshop in 2014 set the research agenda by introducing each group to the other, illustrating state-of-the-art methods, reporting on current research problems, and brainstorming about common interests. The second workshop in 2015 further elaborated these themes. This third BIR workshop aims to foster a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services into scholarly search engine interfaces. In particular we will address specific communities, as well as studies on large, cross-domain collections like Mendeley and Research‐ Gate. This third BIR workshop addresses explicitly both scholarly and industrial researchers.},

abstract = {Probabilistic Datalog (PDatalog, proposed in 1995) is a probabilistic variant of Datalog and a nice conceptual idea to model Information Retrieval in a log- ical, rule-based programming paradigm. Making PDat- alog work in real-world applications requires more than probabilistic facts and rules, and the semantics associ- ated with the evaluation of the programs. We report in this paper some of the key features of the HySpirit system required to scale the execution of PDatalog pro- grams. Firstly, there is the requirement to express probabil- ity estimation in PDatalog. Secondly, fuzzy-like predi- cates are required to model vague predicates (e.g. vague match of attributes such as age or price). Thirdly, to handle large data sets there are scalability issues to be addressed, and therefore, HySpirit provides probabilis- tic relational indexes and parallel and distributed pro- cessing. The main contribution of this paper is a con- solidated view on the methods of the HySpirit system to make PDatalog applicable in real-scale applications that involve a wide range of requirements typical for data (information) management and analysis.},

Several technologies, methods, and techniques are used by perpetrators to terrorise victims. While spam email filtering systems have been effective by applying various statistical and machine learning algorithms, utilising text catego- rization and filtering to detect text- and email-based cyberstalking is an interesting new application. There is also the need to gather evidence by the victim. To this end we discuss a framework to detect cyberstalking in messages; short message service, multimedia messaging service, chat, instance messaging and emails, and as well as to support documenting evidence. Our framework consists of five main modules: a detection module which detects cyberstalking using message categorisation; an attacker identification module based on cyberstalkers' previous messages history, personalisation module, aggregator module and messages and evidence collection module. We discuss our ongoing work and how different text categorization and machine learning approaches can be applied to identify cyberstalkers.},

A recent development in bibliographic databases is to use advanced information retrieval techniques in combination with bibliographic means like citations. In this work we will present an approach that combines a cognitive information retrieval framework based on the principle of polyrepresentation with document clustering to enable the user to explore a collection more interactively than by just examining a ranked result list. Our approach uses information need representations as well as different document representations including citations. To evaluate our ideas we employ a simulated user strategy utilising a cluster ranking approach. We report on the possible effectiveness of our approach and on several strategies how users can achieve a higher search effectiveness through cluster browsing. Our results confirm that our proposed polyrepresentative cluster browsing strategy can in principle significantly improve the search effectiveness.

However, previous research shows that the rate of adoption and success of e-government systems vary significantly across countries. It is argued here that culture can be an important factor affecting e- government success. This paper aims to explore the relevance of personal values to the e-government success from an individual user's perspective. The ten basic values identified by Schwartz were used. A Delphi study was carried out with a group of experts to identify the most relevant personal values to the e-government success from an individual's point of view. The findings suggest that four of the ten values, namely Self-direction, Security, Stimulation, and Tradition, most likely affect the success. The findings provide a basis for developing a comprehensive e-government evaluation framework to be validated using a large scale survey in Saudi Arabia.},

abstract = {The evaluation of information systems (IS) has been of great interest to researchers in the last few decades. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted on the assessment of e-government systems success. e-Government improves services and efficiency and assists in building trust between governments and the public. The importance of evaluating e-government systems comes from the need of governments to ascertain what investments in the delivery of services using e-government systems via Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are appropriate. The aim of this research is to explore the main aspects and factors for evaluating e- government systems success. The study has been conducted in the context of the Saudi government. This government has invested heavily in ICT infrastructure and e-government systems in the last decade. This huge investment reflects the ambition of the government to exploit the advantages of using e-government systems to deliver government services to the public via ICT. Accordingly, the Yesser Program was established in 2005 as an e-government initiative in conjunction with the Communication and Information Technology Commission (CITC) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF). To achieve the aim of this study, interviews were conducted with 49 Saudi citizens to explore their perceptions of e-government systems and their success. The interviewees who participated in our study were varied in their demographic information. The responses of the interviewees will help to identify the success factors of e-governments systems and establish a preliminary framework for evaluating e-government success. The study objectives have been achieved and the findings reveal many issues regarding the factors that affect e-government systems success.},

One of the consequences of this framework is the polyrepresentation principle. The Logical Uncertainty Principle (LUP) is regarded as a compatible model with the cognitive framework. Recently it was shown how LUP can be expressed using the mathematics of Hilbert spaces. This formalism, which is applied in quantum mechanics, harmonises geometry, probability theory and logics. Apart from being a way to express LUP, a further potential arises from a quantum perspective of IR. We present an interactive framework as an example of a quantum-inspired approach which also supports polyrepresentation.},

abstract = {This study explores the benefits of integrating knowledge representations in prior art patent retrieval. Key to the introduced approach is the utilization of human judgment available in the form of classifications assigned to patent documents. The paper first outlines in detail how a methodology for the extraction of knowledge from such an hierarchical classification system can be established. Further potential ways of integrating this knowledge with existing Information Retrieval paradigms in a scalable and flexible manner are investigated. Finally based on these integration strategies the effectiveness in terms of recall and precision is evaluated in the context of a prior art search task for European patents. As a result of this evaluation it can be established that in general the proposed knowledge expansion techniques are particularly beneficial to recall and, with respect to optimizing field retrieval settings, further result in significant precision gains.},

abstract = {The relevance of a document has many facets, going beyond the usual topical one, which have to be considered to satisfy a user's information need. Multiple representations of doc- uments, like user-given reviews or the actual document con- tent, can give evidence towards certain facets of relevance. In this respect polyrepresentation of documents, where such evidence is combined, is a crucial concept to estimate the relevance of a document. In this paper, we discuss how a ge- ometrical retrieval framework inspired by quantum mechan- ics can be extended to support polyrepresentation. We show by example how different representations of a document can be modelled in a Hilbert space, similar to physical systems known from quantum mechanics. We further illustrate how these representations are combined by means of the tensor product to support polyrepresentation, and discuss the case that representations of documents are not independent from a user point of view. Besides giving a principled framework for polyrepresentation, the potential of this approach is to capture and formalise the complex interdependent relation- ships that the different representations can have between each other.},

abstract = {Annotations are a means to make critical remarks, to explain and comment things, to add notes and give opinions, and to relate objects. Nowadays, they can be found in digital libraries and collaboratories, for example as a building block for scientific discussion on the one hand or as private notes on the other. We further find them in product reviews, scientific databases and many ``Web 2.0'' applications; even well-established concepts like emails can be regarded as annotations in a certain sense. Digital annotations can be (textual) comments, markings (i.e.\ highlighted parts) and references to other documents or document parts. Since annotations convey information which is potentially important to satisfy a user's information need, this thesis tries to answer the question of how to exploit annotations for information retrieval. It gives a first answer to the question if retrieval effectiveness can be improved with annotations. A survey of the ``annotation universe'' reveals some facets of annotations; for example, they can be content level annotations (extending the content of the annotation object) or meta level ones (saying something about the annotated object). Besides the annotations themselves, other objects created during the process of annotation can be interesting for retrieval, these being the annotated fragments. These objects are integrated into an object-oriented model comprising digital objects such as structured documents and annotations as well as fragments. In this model, the different relationships among the various objects are reflected. From this model, the basic data structure for annotation-based retrieval, the structured annotation hypertext, is derived. In order to thoroughly exploit the information contained in structured annotation hypertexts, a probabilistic, object-oriented logical framework called POLAR is introduced. In POLAR, structured annotation hypertexts can be modelled by means of probabilistic propositions and four-valued logics. POLAR allows for specifying several relationships among annotations and annotated (sub)parts or fragments. Queries can be posed to extract the knowledge contained in structured annotation hypertexts. POLAR supports annotation-based retrieval, i.e.\ document and discussion search, by applying an augmentation strategy (knowledge augmentation, propagating propositions from subcontexts like annotations, or relevance augmentation, where retrieval status values are propagated) in conjunction with probabilistic inference, where P(d \rightarrow q), the probability that a document d implies a query q, is estimated. POLAR's semantics is based on possible worlds and accessibility relations. It is implemented on top of four-valued probabilistic Datalog. POLAR's core retrieval functionality, knowledge augmentation with probabilistic inference, is evaluated for discussion and document search. The experiments show that all relevant POLAR objects, merged annotation targets, fragments and content annotations, are able to increase retrieval effectiveness when used as a context for discussionor document search. Additional experiments reveal that we can determine the polarity of annotations with an accuracy of around 80%.},

Systems like POLAR are able to integrate such values into the retrieval function. To automatically detect the polarity of postings, they need to be classified into positive and negative ones w.r.t.\ the comment or document they are annotating. We present a machine learning approach for polarity detection which is based on Support Vector Machines. We discuss and identify appropriate term and context features.

Annotation-based document retrieval aims at exploiting annotations as a rich source of evidence for document search.

In order to evaluate this approach and POLAR's performance in document search, we set up a test collection based on a snapshot of ZDNet News, containing IT-related articles and attached discussion threads.

Insights about these\ncharacteristics are gained by an analysis of the annotation models behind\nexisting systems and a discussion of an object-oriented, logical view\non relevant objects in a digital library. Retrieval methods applied in a\ndigital library should take annotations into account to satisfy users'\ninformation needs. POLAR thus supports a wide range of flexible and powerful\nannotation-based fact and content queries by\nmaking use of knowledge and relevance augmentation. An evaluation of our\napproach on email discussions shows performance improvements when\nannotation characteristics are considered.},

abstract = {Mediating between available information objects and individual information needs is a central issue within the Information Society. In the simplest case this is an information request answered by a search engine based on the analysis of the content of individual information objects within an information collection that may be a digital library, but also the World Wide Web. However, neither the information search activity nor the information objects within the collection are isolated entities. They are both equipped with a multifaceted context. This talk discusses complementing ways to make such context explicit and to use it to improve the information mediation process. In general "the context of something consists of the ideas, situations, events, or information that relate to it and make it possible to understand it fully". When information (or knowledge) is represented, context is generally left implicit. This strategy enables concise representation and communication of information under the assumption that relevant parts of the context are shared or given as background knowledge. If context is to be explicitly represented, as it is, for example, done in knowledge representation, it can be used for reasoning and decision making. In order to enable an effective use of context, it is important that the "right" aspects of the context are to be modeled and that the relationship between the context representation and the representation of the "something" in the context is clearly defined. This also holds true, when using context in intelligent information access support. The most obvious and common way to represent context for information objects are metadata like bibliographic metadata that embed an information object in information mainly about its creation process. This is, however, capturing only part of the original context an information object was created in. Many information objects, like e.g. propaganda films, can only be fully understood, if more information about their original context is available, like e.g. the time, the political situation or the history of the creator. This original context is in most cases different from the context, in which the information object is perceived and inspected (perceived context). This perceived context can, for example, be represented by classification information and by the enclosing information collection, which also contribute to the interpretation of an information object. Furthermore, hypertext documents are embedded into a context of linked documents and can only be fully interpreted if they are understood as part of such information object networks. Some retrieval methods already exploit this type of context. However, further explicit context representation is required to create awareness for the original context. This can for example be done by enriching information objects with annotations. Annotations can even be used to embed an information object in the context of a discourse. If the different facets of the context of an information object, the information context, is made explicit and analyzed, it can be used in the mediation process basing the information access process on a richer picture of the information object. The second entity in the information mediation process, the information request or more general the information access activity, is part of a user task that provides a context to this activity. This context, the user context, is determined by the task, but also by user interests, skills and other user characteristics, as well as results of preceding activities. Part of this context is captured by personalization approaches that model e.g. user interests and use it for individual information filtering. Extended user (context) modeling makes further dimensions of the context, like e.g. the relationship a user is involved in or the current user task, explicit requiring new matchmaking method for exploiting them in the information mediation process. Both, the user context as well as the information context, are captured by some type of metadata building upon a metadata schema like e.g. the Dublin Core (DC). The interpretation of metadata by humans as well as by machines relies on a shared understanding of the concept underlying the metadata schema. Thus, one abstraction level higher, Ontologies provide context to the interpretation of metadata. This context can be made explicit by referring to formally defined ontologies that define the concepts used in the metadata schema e.g. on the basis of more basic terms and predicates. Making this context explicit it is possible to combine metadata based on different metadata schemata by tracing them back to a shared context (the more basic concepts). {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

They will open the Digital Library (DL) technology to a wider clientele, allow faster adaptability and enable the usage of federative models on content and service provision. These technologies raise new challenges for the realization of DL functionalities, which are rooted in the increased heterogeneity of content, services and metadata, in the higher degree of distribution and dynamics, as well as in the omission of a central control instance. This paper discusses these opportunities and challenges for three central types of DL functionality revolving around information access: metadata management, retrieval functionality, and personalization services. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},
