In the form of shared, textual and nested annotations they can be used to model discussions. Such discussions contain additional information that can be interesting for both document and discussion search. In my thesis I am going to develop a formal annotation model and, based on this, discuss and evaluate probabilistic indexing and retrieval models for annotation-based document and discussion search.},

This led to the establishment of the Heterogeneous Track at INEX 2006. The goal of the track was to set up a testbed consisting of several different and diverse collections and defining retrieval tasks and appropriate topics. These are the foundations for the Heterogeneous Track at INEX 2007, where the focus is on run submissions, relevance assessments and proper evaluation of the proposed methods dealing with a heterogeneous collection.},

  abstract = {
While the primary INEX test collection is based on a single
DTD, it is realistic to assume that most XML collections consist of
documents from different sources. This leads to a heterogeneity of syntax,
semantics and document genre. In order to cope with the challenges
posed by such a diverse environment, the heterogeneous track was offered
at INEX 2006. Within this track, we set up a collection consisting
of several different and diverse collections. We defined retrieval tasks and
identified a set of topics. These are the foundations for future run
submissions,
relevance assessments and proper evaluation of the proposed
methods dealing with a heterogeneous collection.
